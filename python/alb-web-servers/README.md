# Overview - Application Load Balancer (ALB/ELBv2)
This script shows and example of Boto3 ELB v2 integration with Neokarm Symphony.
After creating 2 webservers and one load-balancer we'll register the instances into the target group.
There's an example of how to register more instances into the target-group later.
It is possible to register as many instances as you need.
If you wish to test the LB you can use the EIP of the LB to verify that it works.
